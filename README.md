# 2-Photon Calcium Imaging Analysis Package
This a set of functions that allow the analysis of neuronal activity recorded in behaving head-fixed mice (running and whisking) using a 2-Photon microscope 

## Input data
- Calcium image data: pre-processed calcium image data from Suite2P (https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p.git)
- Locomotion data: a file with a position over time
- Whisking data: imaging data from mouse whiskers processed with Facemap (https://github.com/MouseLand/facemap.git)

## Analysis process
